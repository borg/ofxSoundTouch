SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library for changing the Tempo, Pitch and Playback Rates of audio streams or audio files

    Tempo (time stretch): Changes the sound to play at faster or slower tempo than originally without affecting the sound pitch.
    Pitch (key) : Changes the sound pitch or key while keeping the original tempo (speed).
    Playback Rate : Changes both tempo and pitch together as if a vinyl disc was played at different RPM rate.

The SoundTouch library is intended  for application developers writing sound processing tools that require tempo/pitch control functionality, or just for playing around with the sound effects.
